In Python, arrays are not as commonly used as other data structures like lists or dictionaries, because Python provides many built-in features that can be used to perform operations that are typically done with arrays in other languages.

However, arrays can still be useful in certain situations, and Python provides several libraries for working with arrays, such as NumPy and Python's built-in array module.
